Hi there, I'm Lydia, a **Data Science** student at the University of Waterloo. 

I am a mathematician at heart, and I apply that logic to the software I write. I am fascinated by algorithmic reasoning, and study computer science in an endeavour to harness human intelligence to build cognitive solutions to complex problems.
