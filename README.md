Hi there, I'm Lydia, a **Data Science** student at the University of Waterloo. 

I am a mathematician at heart, and I apply that logic to the software I write. I am fascinated by algorithmic reasoning, and study computer science in an endeavour to understand human intelligence and harness it to develop smart solutions to complex problems.
